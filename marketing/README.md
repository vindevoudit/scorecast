# Bantryx — Social Media Marketing Kit

Ready-to-post, on-brand graphics for the Bantryx launch campaign. Everything in
[`out/`](out/) is generated from committed SVG templates + the bundled brand fonts, so
you can tweak copy/colours and re-render the whole set in one command.

```bash
npm run assets:marketing       # → marketing/out/*.png
```

- **Edit copy** (headlines, features, stats, steps): the `FEATURES` / `STATS` / `STEPS`
  arrays near the top of [`scripts/generate-marketing-assets.mjs`](../scripts/generate-marketing-assets.mjs).
- **Edit colours / wordmark / icons / type**: [`marketing/lib/brand.mjs`](lib/brand.mjs)
  (`COLOR`, `FONT`, `wordmark`, `brandTag`, `iconBadge`).
- **Full maintainer guide** — how the system is built and how to modify graphics or add new
  ones (fragment API, icon system, layout renderers, the live favicon/PWA/OG pipeline):
  **[GRAPHICS.md](GRAPHICS.md)**.
- **Fonts** ([`fonts/`](fonts/)): Orbitron (BANTRYX wordmark + B mark), Bebas Neue
  (headlines + big numbers), Inter (body) — all **SIL OFL 1.1**, free to embed and
  redistribute. Fed to the rasterizer directly so type renders in the real brand faces
  (not a system fallback). Icons are clean Lucide-style geometry (ISC-licensed) with a
  cyan glow.

> **Product mockups** are faithful re-creations of the live app UI (real dark-theme
> tokens, real component layout) populated with past Premier League fixtures + fake users.
> They're the most credible "here's what you actually get" assets — lead with them.

> **Flyer printing**: `flyer-a4.png` is 300 dpi A4. Print "actual size / 100%" (not
> "fit to page") so the QR stays crisp. The QR encodes `https://bantryx.com` and includes
> a white quiet-zone border — don't crop into the white frame.

Use `launch-card.png` wherever a link unfurls (X, Discord, Slack, LinkedIn, WhatsApp) — it
matches the site's OG image. Pin the flyer in real-world spots (clubhouses, campus boards,
group-chat screenshots).

## Regenerating

The script is deterministic — re-running produces identical PNGs. To change anything:

1. Edit copy in `scripts/generate-marketing-assets.mjs` (content arrays) or brand tokens
   in `marketing/lib/brand.mjs`.
2. `npm run assets:marketing`
3. The 29 PNGs in `out/` are overwritten in place.

To add a new format, add an entry to `SIZE` and a `renderX` layout function, then an
`emit(...)` call in `main()`.
